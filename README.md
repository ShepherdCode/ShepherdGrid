* Cluster sets of identical desktop computers previously used in classrooms.
* Create a Beowulf cluster supporting distributed processing with local storage.
* Use existing rack mounting in CME server closet.
* Provision one switch and sufficient ethernet cabling.

## Batch control

## Node configuration
* 450 GB disk
* Win10 already installed and auto updated. We could overwrite this to reclaim the full disk for Linux.
* Ubuntu.
    * We test installed Ubuntu on one node. The node now has dual boot. Booting into Ubuntu works. (5/14/18)
